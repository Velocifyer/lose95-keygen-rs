# A tool to generate losedows 95 keys

It Generates a losedows 95 retail key in the format BBB-AAAAAAA and a losedows 95 OEM key in the format CCCDD-OEM-00AAAAA-RRRRR where CCC is 3 digits < 367 and DD is 95 or 96 or 97 or 98 or 99
or 00 or 01 or 02 or 03 and RRRRR is 5 random digits where BBB is 3 digits that are not 333 or 444 or 555 or 666 or 777 or 888 or 999
and AAAAAAA is 7 digits where the sum of them is divisible by 7 with no remainder and 00AAAAA is the same but the first 2 digits are 0.
 Losedows 95 does not actualy care about charector 3 of the retail key

Can be ran as a command in the syntax 
`lose95-keygen-rs version keys_printed`
Version currently can only be `0` but in the future will be able to controll what format arguments will be taken in and what format stuff will be outputted in. 
Keys_printed defaults to 255(`all`) witch println!s all keys but if set to 0(`retail`) it only println!s the retail key and if it is 1(`OEM`) (case insensitive) it only println!s the oem key
To use as a library use gen_retail(0) to generate a retail key as a String
or gen_oem(0) to generate a OEM key as a String
